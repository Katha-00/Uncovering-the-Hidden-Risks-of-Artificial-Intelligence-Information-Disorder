Given your situation, it's essential to take proactive steps to improve your retirement prospects. Here are some recommendations based on general financial planning principles and specific considerations for Austria:

1. **Debt Repayment**: Focus on paying off your outstanding debt of €15,000 as soon as possible. Consider consolidating your debt into a single loan with a lower interest rate, if possible. According to the Austrian Consumer Protection Association (Verein für Konsumenteninformation), debt consolidation can simplify your payments and potentially save you money on interest (Source: [VKI - Verein für Konsumenteninformation](https://www.konsument.at/)).

2. **Increase Income or Reduce Expenses**: Explore ways to either increase your income or reduce your expenses to allocate more funds towards debt repayment and savings. This could involve taking on a side job, selling unused items, or negotiating a raise at work. The Austrian Federal Ministry of Labor, Family and Youth (Bundesministerium für Arbeit, Familie und Jugend) provides resources on increasing income and managing finances (Source: [BMAFJ - Bundesministerium für Arbeit, Familie und Jugend](https://www.bmafj.gv.at/)).

3. **Private Retirement Savings**: Start building your private retirement savings. Austria offers various options for private pensions, such as the "Betriebliche Vorsorge" (occupational pension) if your employer offers it, or private pension insurance (e.g., "Pensionssparbuch" or "Pensionskasse"). The Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA) provides information on these options (Source: [FMA - Finanzmarktaufsicht](https://www.fma.gv.at/)).

4. **Maximize State Pension**: Ensure you understand how the Austrian state pension system works and how you can maximize your benefits. The Austrian Pension Insurance Institution (Pensionsversicherungsanstalt) can provide detailed information on your current pension entitlement and how to optimize it (Source: [PVA - Pensionsversicherungsanstalt](https://www.pva.at/)).

5. **Emergency Fund**: Once you've made progress on your debt, aim to build an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of living expenses. This fund will help you avoid going further into debt when unexpected expenses arise (Source: [The Balance](https://www.thebalance.com/)).

6. **Long-term Investment**: Consider investing in long-term financial products that can grow your savings over time, such as stocks, bonds, or investment funds. However, it's crucial to understand the risks and potentially consult with a financial advisor. The Vienna Stock Exchange (Wiener Börse) offers information on investment options (Source: [Wiener Börse](https://www.wienerboerse.at/)).

7. **Housing Considerations**: Since you're currently renting, you might want to explore options for securing affordable housing in retirement. This could involve looking into rent-controlled apartments or considering purchasing a property if it becomes financially viable (Source: [Wikipedia - Rentenwohnung](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rentenwohnung)).

8. **Financial Counseling**: Given the complexity of your situation, it might be beneficial to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances and goals. The Austrian Association of Financial Planners (Österreichischer Berufsverband Financial Planners) can help you find a certified financial planner (Source: [ÖBF - Österreichischer Berufsverband Financial Planners](https://www.oebf.at/)).
