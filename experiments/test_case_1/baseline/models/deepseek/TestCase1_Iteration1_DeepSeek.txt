Given your situation, it’s important to take proactive steps to improve your retirement outlook. Below is a structured plan based on Austrian pension rules, debt management, and retirement savings strategies.  

### **1. Understand Your Expected State Pension (Gesetzliche Pension)**  
In Austria, the state pension is calculated based on your **contributory years** and **average lifetime earnings**. Key points:  
- The full pension age is **65 for men** (gradually increasing to 65 by 2033).  
- You need **45 contributory years** for the maximum pension (but partial pensions are possible).  
- The **pension benefit formula** considers your best **30 years** of earnings (adjusted for inflation).  

**Estimate your pension:**  
- Use the **Pensionskonto** service from the [Austrian Social Security (ÖGK)](https://www.oegk.at/) or the [Pension Calculator](https://www.pensionsversicherung.at/) by the **Pensionsversicherungsanstalt (PVA)**.  
- A rough estimate: If you earn €50,000 gross (~€40,000 net), your pension could be **~50-60% of your net income** (€1,600–€2,000/month).  

**Action:**  
✔ Request a **pension statement** from PVA to know your projected income.  

---  
### **2. Pay Off Your €15,000 Debt Before Retirement**  
Carrying debt into retirement reduces disposable income.  
- **Strategy:**  
  - Use a **debt snowball method** (pay smallest debts first) or **debt avalanche** (highest interest first).  
  - Consider a **low-interest consolidation loan** (check banks like **Erste Bank, Raiffeisen**).  
  - Avoid new debt and cut discretionary spending.  

---  
### **3. Build Private Retirement Savings**  
Since the state pension may not cover all expenses, you need supplementary savings.  

#### **a) Company Pension Schemes (Betriebliche Vorsorge)**  
- If your employer offers a **Mitarbeitervorsorgekasse (MVK)**, contribute (some match contributions).  

#### **b) Private Pension Plans (Privatvorsorge)**  
- **Pension Insurance (Pensionsversicherung):**  
  - **Example:** **"Wahlpension"** (from insurers like **Allianz, Wiener Städtische**) – guarantees lifelong payouts.  
- **ETF-Based Savings (Fondssparplan):**  
  - Invest in low-cost ETFs (e.g., **MSCI World**) via brokers like **Flatex, Dadat**.  
  - Even €200/month at 5% return could grow to **~€90,000 in 15 years**.  

#### **c) Tax-Advantaged Savings (Zukunftsvorsorge)**  
- The **"Zukunftsvorsorge"** program offers **tax deductions** (up to €1,200/year).  
- Providers: **VBV, Valida, or insurance companies**.  

---  
### **4. Reduce Expenses & Increase Savings Rate**  
- **Track spending** (apps like **MoneyWiz, Bankomat**).  
- **Downsize rent** if possible (average Austrian rent: ~€800–€1,200).  
- **Side income** (part-time work, freelancing).  

---  
### **5. Consider Working Longer (If Possible)**  
- Delaying retirement increases your pension (each extra year adds ~4-5%).  
- Part-time work post-retirement can supplement income.  

---  
### **6. Government Support (If Needed)**  
- If your pension is very low, check **"Ausgleichszulage"** (means-tested top-up).  

### **Final Checklist:**  
✅ Get official **pension estimate** (PVA).  
✅ **Pay off €15k debt** aggressively (~3–5 years).  
✅ Start **ETF savings** (€200–€500/month).  
✅ Check **employer pension options**.  
✅ Consider **tax-efficient "Zukunftsvorsorge"**.
