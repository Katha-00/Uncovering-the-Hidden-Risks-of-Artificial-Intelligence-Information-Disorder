Given your situationâ€”a 50-year-old in Austria with a strong work history but minimal private savings and some debtâ€”here are clear, prioritized steps you can take now to improve your retirement outlook:

---

### 1. Repay high-interest personal debt first ðŸ§¾
Carrying ~â‚¬15,000 in personal debt reduces your ability to save and grows over time. Create a strict repayment scheduleâ€”such as a **debt snowball** (pay off smallest balances first) or **debt avalanche** (highest interest first). Freeing up even â‚¬200â€“â‚¬300/month makes room for retirement contributions.

---

### 2. Maximize voluntary top-up to state pension
Austria allows voluntary contributions ("Ausfallszeiten") to increase statutory pension entitlements. Each year of top-up counts for your pension accountâ€”currently, **1.78 % of your gross income** is credited annually toward your pension ([finanznavi.gv.at](https://finanznavi.gv.at), [oecd.org](https://www.oecd.org)).  
If possible, make lump-sum or monthly contributions to boost your future pension. Even adding a few years' worth can make a noticeable long-term difference.

### 3. Join an employerâ€™s occupational pension scheme (Pensionskasse)
These employer-sponsored pension funds are a valuable **second pillar**; employer contributions (up to ~10 % salary) are **tax-deductible** and invested for retirement ([pensionfundsonline.co.uk](https://www.pensionfundsonline.co.uk)).  
Ask your employer about this benefit and opt inâ€”ideally with a matching contribution plan.

### 4. Start a private pension or investment plan
Even modest, regular savings in **low-cost investment vehicles** like ETFs, mutual funds, or retirement insurance can grow significantly over 15 years. Consider:
- A private pension insurance or dedicated retirement plan through banks/insurers ([finanznavi.gv.at](https://finanznavi.gv.at)).
- A broader investment portfolio with diversified funds to outpace inflation.

Explore plans offering **tax benefits**. Though private pensions in Austria are smaller than state ones, they help buffer against potential state pension cuts.

### 5. Consider real estate long-term
Owning your home can eliminate rent and preserve wealth.  
Even in rented accommodation, saving toward a down payment on modest propertyâ€”even a small co-op or apartmentâ€”can dramatically reduce future housing costs and boost net worth.

---

### 6. Understand minimum pension and top-up support
Austria's **Ausgleichszulage** ensures a minimum pension of ~â‚¬1,274/month for singles (2025), provided you meet contribution requirements (~180 months, 15 years) ([oecd.org](https://www.oecd.org)).  
There's also a bonus for 30+ years' contributions, enhancing older-age support. Ensuring you reach those thresholds can safeguard a basic income in retirement.

---

### 7. Delay retirement if possible
Postponing retirement beyond 65 adds a **5.1% bonus per year** (up to about 15.3%) to your monthly pension ([oesterreich.gv.at](https://www.oesterreich.gv.at)).  
Working even a couple of years longer can significantly boost your pension income.

---

### 8. Consult a financial advisor or pension expert
A professional can assess your situation, help optimize contributions (state top-ups, occupational fund, private pensions), evaluate real estate plans, and devise **tax-efficient strategies** for debt repayment and savings.

## ðŸ“‹ Suggested Action Plan (Timeline)

| Timeframe     | Goal                                                                 |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0â€“6 months    | Create debt repayment plan, cut unnecessary expenses, unlock free cash flow |
| 6â€“12 months   | Join employer pension fund; start voluntary state top-up; begin small monthly private savings |
| 1â€“3 years     | Ramp up private savings/investments; evaluate home purchase feasibility |
| 3â€“15+ years   | Continue steady savings; refinance buy-to-live property if possible |
| Age 65+       | Delay pension to maximize payout; apply for Ausgleichszulage if eligible; enjoy stable retirement income |

## Why This Matters
- **State pension** remains Austriaâ€™s first pillar, earning up to ~80% of average lifetime earnings after 45 years of contributions ([englishspeakersinaustria.com](https://englishspeakersinaustria.com), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org)).  
- **Occupational pensions** supplement it significantly and offer tax benefits ([finanznavi.gv.at](https://finanznavi.gv.at)).  
- **Private savings** fill gaps and combat inflation.  
- **Debt reduction** frees up income and avoids interest drag.

---

## In summary
By tackling **personal debt**, maximizing all **three pension pillars** (statutory, occupational, private), considering **delaying retirement**, and possibly **entering the property market**, you'll build a more secure future.  

Meanwhile, Austriaâ€™s welfare system provides a baselineâ€”**Ausgleichszulage**â€”that helps ensure basic standards.
