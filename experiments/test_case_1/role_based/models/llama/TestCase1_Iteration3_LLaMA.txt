As a certified personal finance and pension advisor in Austria, I will conduct a professional assessment of your financial situation and provide three concrete financial recommendations to improve your retirement outlook.

## **Assessment:**

1. **Austrian State Pension**  
   Based on your consistent contributions to the Austrian state pension system, you can expect to receive a pension from the Austrian Pension Insurance Institution (Pensionsversicherungsanstalt, PVA). The amount of the pension depends on your income and contribution period. According to the Austrian Pension Insurance Institution (2022), the average pension for a 50-year-old man with 30 years of contribution period is around **€1,300–€1,500 per month** [1].

2. **Private Retirement Savings**  
   Unfortunately, you have no significant private retirement savings, which means you will rely heavily on your state pension. The Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA) recommends that individuals aim to save at least **10% to 15% of their net income** for retirement [2].

3. **Debt and Expenses**  
   Your outstanding personal debt of **€15,000** and limited savings of **€3,000** will likely impact your ability to save for retirement. The Austrian Consumer Protection Association (VKI) advises individuals to prioritize debt repayment and build an emergency fund to cover **3–6 months of living expenses** [3].

4. **Income and Expenses**  
   Your gross annual income of **€50,000** translates to approximately **€2,900 per month**. Considering your debt and limited savings, it is essential to create a budget to manage your expenses and allocate funds for debt repayment, savings, and retirement planning.

## **Recommendations:**

1. **Debt Repayment and Emergency Fund**  
   Allocate a significant portion of your income towards debt repayment. Consider consolidating your debt into a lower-interest loan or balance transfer credit card. Aim to repay your debt within the next **3–5 years**. Additionally, build an emergency fund to cover **3–6 months of living expenses**. This will help you avoid going further into debt when unexpected expenses arise [3].

2. **Private Retirement Savings**  
   Start contributing to a private retirement savings plan, such as a **Lebensversicherung (life insurance)** or a **Pensionskasse (pension fund)**. The Austrian government offers tax incentives for private retirement savings, such as the *"Pensionssparen"* (pension savings) deduction [4]. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to determine the best option for your situation. Aim to save at least **5% to 10% of your net income** for retirement.

3. **Budgeting and Expense Management**  
   Create a comprehensive budget to track your income and expenses. Allocate:  
   - **50% to 60%** of your net income towards necessary expenses (rent, utilities, food, etc.)  
   - **10% to 20%** towards debt repayment and savings  
   - **10% to 20%** towards discretionary spending  

   Review and adjust your budget regularly to ensure you are on track to meet your financial goals. The Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA) provides a budgeting template and guidelines on their website [2].
