### Step-by-Step Financial Evaluation

#### 1. **Assess the Current Financial Situation**
   - **Income**: €50,000 gross per year (~€2,500–€3,000 net/month after taxes and social security).  
   - **Debt**: €15,000 in personal debt (likely with moderate interest, e.g., 5–10%).  
   - **Assets**: €3,000 in savings (minimal emergency fund).  
   - **Housing**: Renting (no property ownership, so no equity or housing cost stability in retirement).  

   *Key Issue*: Low savings and outstanding debt threaten financial stability in retirement. The lack of private savings means reliance on the state pension, which may not cover living expenses.

#### 2. **Estimate Potential Austrian State Pension Benefits**
   - Austria’s state pension is based on "pension insurance periods" (contributions) and lifetime earnings. The formula considers:  
     - **Assessment base**: Average lifetime earnings (capped at €5,370/month in 2023).  
     - **Accrual rate**: 1.78% per year of contributions (max 80% of assessment base after 45 years).  
   - **Calculation for this case**:  
     - 30+ years of contributions → ~53.4% (30 × 1.78%) of average lifetime earnings.  
     - Assuming average earnings close to current salary: ~€50,000 × 53.4% = **€26,700/year gross pension** (~€1,800–€2,000/month net).  
   - **Pension Gap**: Rent, utilities, and living costs in Austria (e.g., Vienna) for a single person could exceed €1,500/month, leaving little margin.

#### 3. **Debt Reduction Before Retirement**
   - **Priority**: Pay off €15,000 debt to avoid interest draining retirement income.  
   - **Action Plan**:  
     - Allocate €500–€700/month from current income (e.g., cut discretionary spending).  
     - Target payoff in 2–3 years (e.g., €15,000 ÷ €600/month = 25 months + interest).  
     - Consider debt consolidation if interest rates are high (e.g., lower-rate personal loan).

#### 4. **Private Savings/Investment Strategies**
   - **Short-term**: Build emergency fund to €10,000 (3–6 months’ expenses) after debt payoff.  
   - **Long-term**:  
     - **Pension-Specific Accounts**: Use Austrian *Mitarbeitervorsorgekasse* (employer-linked pension funds) or *Privatvorsorge* (private pension insurance) with tax incentives.  
     - **Low-Risk Investments**: ETFs (e.g., MSCI World) with monthly contributions (e.g., €200–€500).  
     - **Real Estate**: If feasible, consider buying a small property (e.g., via *Eigenheimförderung* subsidies) to stabilize housing costs.

#### 5. **Risk Exposure and Resilience**
   - **Risks**:  
     - Health issues (Austria has universal healthcare, but long-term care costs could arise).  
     - Inflation eroding pension value.  
     - Market volatility if investing late.  
   - **Mitigation**:  
     - Prioritize debt-free status to reduce fixed obligations.  
     - Diversify savings (e.g., state pension + private funds + ETFs).

### **Actionable Steps to Take Now**  
1. **Aggressively Pay Down Debt**: Commit €600/month to clear €15,000 debt in ~2.5 years. Free up cash flow for savings.  
2. **Start Private Pension Contributions**: Open a *Privatvorsorge* account (tax-deductible up to €5,292/year) and invest €200–€300/month.  
3. **Explore Housing Stability**: Research subsidized home-buying programs (e.g., *Eigenheimförderung*) or downsize rental to save for a future purchase.
