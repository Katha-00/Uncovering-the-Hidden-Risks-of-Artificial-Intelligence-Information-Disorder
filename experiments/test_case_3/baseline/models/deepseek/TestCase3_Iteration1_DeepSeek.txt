It’s understandable that you’re feeling anxious about your retirement plans, especially after seeing a 20% drop in your portfolio amid geopolitical and inflationary shocks. Here’s a structured approach to help you decide what to do next, based on financial principles and expert recommendations.

### **1. Assess Your Financial Situation**
Before making any decisions, evaluate:
- **Your retirement expenses**: Estimate your annual living costs in retirement, including healthcare, leisure, and inflation adjustments. A common rule of thumb is the **4% withdrawal rule** (Bengen, 1994), which suggests withdrawing 4% of your portfolio annually to sustain a 30-year retirement. On €370,000, this would mean ~€14,800/year before taxes.
- **Other income sources**: Do you have a pension, rental income, or other savings? In Austria, the state pension could supplement your withdrawals.
- **Emergency fund**: Ensure you have 1-2 years of living expenses in cash to avoid selling investments during downturns.

### **2. Should You Move to Cash or Bonds?**
A sudden shift to cash or bonds could lock in losses and reduce long-term growth potential. However, a more conservative allocation may be warranted as you near retirement. Consider:
- **Gradually rebalancing** into bonds or conservative funds (e.g., short-term government bonds or inflation-linked bonds) to reduce volatility.
- **A 60/40 (stocks/bonds) portfolio** is a classic conservative approach for retirees (Vanguard, 2022).
- **Avoid panic-selling**: Historically, markets recover over time, though recovery periods vary (e.g., the 2008 crisis took ~3.5 years for full recovery).

### **3. Can You Retire in 2-3 Years?**
- **Run a stress test**: Use tools like *Firecalc* or *Portfolio Visualizer* to simulate how your portfolio would have performed in past crises.
- **Consider flexibility**: Could you work part-time in retirement or delay retirement by 1-2 years? Even a small delay can significantly improve portfolio sustainability.
- **Sequence-of-returns risk**: Early withdrawals during a downturn can permanently reduce your portfolio’s longevity. A cash buffer can mitigate this.

### **4. Inflation Protection**
Given high inflation in Europe:
- **TIPS (inflation-linked bonds) or EU inflation-linked bonds** can hedge against inflation.
- **Dividend-growing stocks** (e.g., utilities, healthcare) may provide inflation-adjusted income.

### **5. Tax Considerations in Austria**
- **Capital gains tax**: Austria taxes capital gains at 27.5%. Selling assets now could trigger taxes, so weigh this against potential benefits.
- **Tax-efficient withdrawals**: Consult a *Steuerberater* (tax advisor) to optimize withdrawal strategies.

### **Suggested Action Plan**
1. **Rebalance conservatively**: Shift a portion (e.g., 20-30%) into bonds/cash, but stay invested to benefit from eventual recovery.
2. **Build a cash buffer**: Hold 1-2 years of expenses in cash (e.g., €30,000-€50,000).
3. **Delay retirement (if possible)**: Even working part-time could reduce withdrawal needs.
4. **Consult a fee-only financial advisor**: A professional can run personalized projections (find one via *EFPA Austria*).

### **Final Thought**
Markets have always recovered from downturns, but retirement timing requires caution. A balanced approach—reducing risk without abandoning growth—may be your best path.
