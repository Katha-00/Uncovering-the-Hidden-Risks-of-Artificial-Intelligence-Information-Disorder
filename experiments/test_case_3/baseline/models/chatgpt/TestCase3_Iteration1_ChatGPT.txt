You're facing a very common and understandable concern. Retirement planning during market volatility can be deeply unsettling—especially when retirement is near. Here's a structured way to think through your situation, with practical steps and evidence-based considerations tailored to someone in your position.

## 📌 Your Situation Summary
- **Age:** 61  
- **Location:** Austria  
- **Investment Portfolio:** €370,000, conservative ETF + some stocks  
- **Loss:** ~20% (€74,000) in 3 months  
- **Retirement timeline:** 2–3 years  
- **Concern:** Whether to sell, shift, or delay retirement

## ✅ 1. Assess Your Financial Need in Retirement
Before making any investment moves, clarify:
- Your annual spending needs in retirement (net of pensions, if any).  
- Expected income from public pensions (e.g., *Österreichische Pensionsversicherung*), private pensions, or rental income.  
- How long your assets need to last—life expectancy could easily be another 25–30 years.  

🔍 **Tool:** Use a retirement income calculator tailored to Austrian systems. A good starting point is:

## ✅ 2. Understand Why You’re Feeling Anxious
A 20% drop feels scary, but context matters:
- Conservative ETF portfolios still carry **equity risk**, and recent geopolitical and inflation events (e.g., Ukraine war, EU inflation spikes) have impacted **global markets**, including bonds.  
- **Recency bias** makes recent losses feel worse than they are over long-term averages.  

**Data:**  
- A typical **60/40 portfolio** has returned ~5–6% annually over the long term, but has also had years with 10–20% losses (source: [Vanguard 2023 market outlook](https://advisors.vanguard.com/insights/article/marketoutlook2023)).  
- A 20% decline, while sharp, is not unusual in crises. It doesn't necessarily require panic-selling.

## ✅ 3. What You Should NOT Do (Based on Evidence)

**Don’t sell everything and move to cash out of fear.**
- Locking in losses turns paper declines into real ones.  
- According to Morningstar, investors who sold during downturns **underperformed** those who stayed the course by ~2–3% annually (source: *Morningstar Behavioral Gap Study, 2020*).  

**Don’t guess market timing.**
- Timing the market consistently is extremely difficult even for professionals.  
- Missing just the **10 best days** in the market over 20 years can reduce returns by over 40% (source: *JP Morgan Asset Management Guide to Retirement 2023*).

## ✅ 4. What You Can Do Instead

### 🧩 A. Shift from Growth to Income + Capital Preservation
You're 2–3 years from retirement—this is a **"glidepath" stage**. You should:
- Rebalance gradually toward a more income-focused and lower-volatility portfolio.  
  - Example: **30% stocks / 70% bonds/cash vs. 60/40**  
- Include **short-term government bonds** or bond ETFs with lower duration risk (especially important in inflation periods).  
- Consider **laddered fixed income or dividend ETFs** for predictable income.

### 🧩 B. Establish a Cash Buffer ("Bucket Strategy")
- Keep **1–2 years of retirement expenses** in cash or very short-term instruments (e.g., savings accounts, money market funds).  
- This protects you from having to sell investments during a down market.  
This strategy is backed by retirement planners like Wade Pfau and institutions like Vanguard and Fidelity.  

---

### 🧩 C. Stress-Test Retirement
Simulate different scenarios using retirement planning software:
- **Base case:** modest 3–4% annual drawdown  
- **Bad case:** markets stay flat or decline for 3 more years  
- **Good case:** partial recovery  

Try **[FIRECalc](https://www.firecalc.com/)** or **[PortfolioVisualizer](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/)** for international modeling.

### 🧩 D. Delay Retirement by 1 Year (If Feasible)
Delaying retirement by even one year:
- Increases pension benefits (Austrian pensions are higher the later you claim)  
- Reduces withdrawals from your portfolio  
- Gives markets time to recover  

Even part-time work or consulting can reduce the need to draw down investments early.
