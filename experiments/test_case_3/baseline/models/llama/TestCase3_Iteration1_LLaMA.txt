I understand your concerns, and it's natural to feel anxious about your retirement plans after a significant market downturn. I'll provide you with some general guidance and considerations, but please note that I'm not a financial advisor, and it's essential to consult with a professional before making any decisions.

**Assessing your situation:**

1. **Portfolio decline:** A 20% decline in your portfolio value is significant, but it's essential to consider the historical context. According to a study by Fidelity Investments, a 20% decline in the stock market is not uncommon, and markets have typically recovered within a few years (Fidelity Investments, 2020).
2. **Time horizon:** With 2â€“3 years until retirement, you're in a critical phase where you need to balance growth and preservation of your capital.
3. **Risk tolerance:** As you're nearing retirement, your risk tolerance may be decreasing, which could lead you to consider more conservative investments.

**Options to consider:**

1. **Rebalancing:** Instead of moving entirely into cash or bonds, you could consider rebalancing your portfolio to its original asset allocation. This can help you maintain a diversified portfolio and potentially reduce risk (Vanguard, 2020).
2. **Diversification:** If you haven't already, consider diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes, sectors, and geographic regions to minimize exposure to specific market risks (Investopedia, 2022).
3. **Bond allocation:** Adding bonds to your portfolio can provide a relatively stable source of income and help reduce volatility. However, keep in mind that bond yields are currently low in Europe, which may impact their attractiveness (European Central Bank, 2022).
4. **Cash allocation:** Holding some cash can provide liquidity and help you avoid forced selling of investments during market downturns. However, keeping too much cash can mean missing out on potential long-term growth (Charles Schwab, 2020).
5. **Delaying retirement:** If you're concerned about your portfolio's sustainability, you could consider delaying retirement by a year or two to allow your investments more time to recover (AARP, 2020).

**Next steps:**

1. **Consult a financial advisor:** A professional can help you assess your individual situation, create a personalized plan, and provide guidance on the best course of action.
2. **Review your expenses:** Make sure you have a clear understanding of your retirement expenses and create a sustainable income plan (The Balance, 2022).
3. **Stay informed:** Continuously monitor market developments and adjust your strategy as needed.

Remember, it's essential to avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. A well-diversified portfolio and a long-term perspective can help you navigate market volatility.
