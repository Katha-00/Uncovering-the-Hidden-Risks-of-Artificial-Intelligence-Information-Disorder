**Empathetic and Evidence-Based Retirement Transition Recommendation**  

**Dear Client,**  

I understand how distressing it is to see your portfolio decline significantly, especially as you approach retirement. Market volatility, particularly during geopolitical crises and inflationary periods, can be emotionally overwhelming. However, let’s assess your situation calmly and strategically to determine the best path forward.  

### **1. Assessing Your Current Financial Position**  
- **Portfolio Value:** €370,000 (now ~€296,000 after a 20% decline).  
- **Time Horizon:** 2-3 years until retirement.  
- **Risk Profile:** Conservative ETF portfolio with some individual stocks.  

A 20% drop is painful, but historically, diversified portfolios recover over time. Since you’re invested in conservative ETFs (likely bonds and defensive equities), the rebound may be slower but steadier than high-risk assets.  

### **2. Should You Move to Cash or Bonds?**  
**Key Considerations:**  
- **Inflation Risk:** Moving entirely to cash exposes you to inflation erosion (Austria’s inflation was **~6% in 2023**, though moderating in 2024—**Statistik Austria**).  
- **Opportunity Cost:** Selling now locks in losses; staying invested allows for potential recovery.  
- **Bonds as a Middle Ground:** Austrian government bonds (e.g., **ÖBFA**-issued) or high-quality corporate bonds (AAA-rated) could provide stability with modest returns.  

**Recommendation:**  
- **Gradual Rebalancing (Not a Full Exit):** Shift a portion (e.g., 20-30%) into short-term Austrian or Eurozone bonds for stability while keeping the rest invested.  
- **Avoid Panic Selling:** Historically, markets recover after shocks—**Erste Group Research** (2024) notes that post-crisis rebounds average **~15-25% over 12-18 months** after geopolitical events.  

### **3. Can You Still Retire in 2-3 Years?**  
Let’s do a simplified projection:  
- **Conservative Withdrawal Rate (3-4% rule):** €296,000 x 3.5% = ~€10,360/year (€863/month) before pensions.  
- **Austrian Pension System:** The average Austrian pension is **~€1,700/month** (source: **PVA – Pensionsversicherungsanstalt**). Combined, this could sustain a modest retirement.  

**If this feels tight:**  
- **Option 1:** Work part-time in retirement (e.g., **"Pensionistenvorsorge"** programs).  
- **Option 2:** Delay retirement by 1-2 years to allow portfolio recovery and additional savings.  

### **4. Long-Term Recovery Expectations**  
- **Market History:** Since 1950, global markets have recovered from downturns within **3-5 years** (source: **OeNB – Österreichische Nationalbank**).  
- **Diversification Helps:** Your conservative ETFs should weather volatility better than aggressive stocks.  

### **Final Recommendations:**  
✔ **Stay Invested (Partially)** – Avoid locking in losses; keep 70-80% in your ETF portfolio.  
✔ **Rebalance Toward Bonds** – Shift some funds into short-duration bonds for stability.  
✔ **Stress-Test Your Plan** – Use tools like **FinanzOnline’s pension calculator** to see different scenarios.  
✔ **Consider Professional Guidance** – A **fee-only advisor (e.g., via VKI or AK Wien)** can personalize your strategy.  

**Remember:** Markets have always recovered, and your conservative approach has protected you from even deeper losses. You’re not alone—many Austrians are navigating similar concerns. With a structured plan, you can still retire securely.
