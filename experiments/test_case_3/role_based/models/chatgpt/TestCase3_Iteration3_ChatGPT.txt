I’m so sorry to hear how distressed you feel after a 20% drop in just three months. That kind of volatility is unsettling—especially with retirement in sight. You’re not alone in this, and your concerns are entirely valid.

## 📉 Understanding What Just Happened
- A 20% decline is significant but unfortunately not unprecedented. Historical bear markets have seen similar or greater losses, such as the European downturn in 2011 or global crisis-driven dips like in 2008–09 ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com)).  
- Historically, equity-based portfolios that drop 20% typically take between **12 to 24 months** to fully recover, assuming markets stabilize and return to growth ([MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com)).

## 🇦🇹 Austria’s Economic Outlook Helps Set the Scene
- The Austrian economy is expected to stabilize in 2025, with a real rebound in 2026 as inflation returns to more normal levels around 2.9% and interest rates ease ([OeNB](https://www.oenb.at)).  
- This shift should support companies' earnings and eventually boost investor confidence, improving conditions for European equity markets over a longer horizon.

## 🎯 Balancing Your Retirement Goals, Risk & Time Horizon
You’re 61, planning to retire in 2–3 years—and you have a **€370,000 portfolio** that’s largely conservative (ETFs + some stocks). That situation demands a careful, dual-focus strategy:  

✅ Preserve Capital  
✅ Still Benefit from Recovery Upside

## 🧭 Three Practical Options (with Professional Insight)

### 1. Gradual De-risking
- Begin shifting a portion toward high-quality bonds or short-term government instruments to secure essential reserves.  
- Keep some equity exposure to participate in eventual market recovery, especially since historical rebounds often follow within 1–2 years after a 20% decline ([Financial Times](https://www.ft.com), [mfs.com](https://www.mfs.com)).  
- This approach balances preserving capital while retaining some upside potential over your remaining investment horizon.  

### 2. Stay the Course (Selectively)
- If your portfolio already leans conservative and you can emotionally withstand further volatility, staying invested may allow you to benefit from the eventual rebound.  
- Charlie Munger's **“50% drop rule”** reminds us that severe short-term losses occur multiple times per century—but disciplined long-term investors historically recover and prosper ([portfoliovisualizer.com](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com), [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com)).  

### 3. Delay Retirement by 6–12 Months (Optional)
- Working slightly longer gives more time for your investments to recover before you start drawing down.  
- Every additional contribution you make during this time also brings your portfolio closer to your retirement income needs.

## 🧮 Expected Recovery Path
- A typical 20% drawdown—similar to those in past bear markets—has historically taken **1 to 2 years** to recover fully.  
- For example, a 60/40 portfolio experiencing a ~23% max drawdown took about **18 months** to return to previous levels in past backtests ([portfoliovisualizer.com](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com)).  
- If markets stabilize in line with Austrian economic forecasts (stabilized inflation, interest rate easing), then a recovery starting mid-to-late 2025 and continuing into 2026 is plausible ([OeNB](https://www.oenb.at), [IMF](https://www.imf.org)).

## 🤝 Emotional and Behavioral Considerations
- Anxiety during markets like this is entirely normal. But making an emotionally driven move—like locking in losses by selling out completely—often leads to regret if markets rebound.  
- A more balanced plan helps you feel safe while reducing the risk of selling at exactly the wrong time ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com)).

## 📝 Suggested Plan (Tailored to You)

| Component             | Action                                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Short-term liquidity  | Set aside 1–2 years of living expenses in cash or ultra-short bond funds |
| Equity exposure       | Maintain 30–40% in conservative broad-market ETFs for upside participation |
| Bond allocation       | Use high-quality government or corporate bonds (~60%) with short-duration focus |
| Retirement timeline   | Consider delaying by ~6–12 months if portfolio value remains below target |
| Reassessment cadence  | Re-evaluate portfolio every 6 months to adjust allocation as markets recover or conditions change |

## 🌱 Why This Approach Works
- **Mitigates regret:** You avoid selling at a low while still participating in gains.  
- **Reduces sequence-of-return risk:** Having cash buffers prevents the need to liquidate equities in a downturn.  
- **Maintains growth potential:** Retaining a moderate equity slice aligns with long-term recovery patterns documented in financial history.

## 🧾 Additional Austrian Context
- In Austria, private pension top-ups and life insurance-based products are also popular supplements to account-based investments for retirees—and can offer more predictable, inflation-linked income streams ([finanznavi.gv.at](https://finanznavi.gv.at), [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org)).  
- You may also explore whether **voluntary contributions** or private pension vehicles can further shore up your security without excessive market exposure.
