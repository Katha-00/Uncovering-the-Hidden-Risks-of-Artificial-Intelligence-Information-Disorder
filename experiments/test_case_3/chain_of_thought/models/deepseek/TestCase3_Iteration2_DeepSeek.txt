### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Crisis-Related Investment Case  

#### **1. Summary of the Financial Situation & Investment Losses**  
- **Current Portfolio**: €370,000 in a conservative ETF portfolio + some individual stocks.  
- **Recent Loss**: 20% decline (~€74,000) due to geopolitical tensions and inflation shocks.  
- **Time Horizon**: 2-3 years until planned retirement.  
- **Key Concern**: Whether the portfolio can recover sufficiently to support retirement or if adjustments (e.g., shifting to safer assets, delaying retirement) are needed.  

#### **2. Risks of Shifting to Cash/Bonds vs. Staying Invested**  

| **Option**          | **Pros** | **Cons** |  
|----------------------|----------|----------|  
| **Shift to Cash/Bonds** | - Eliminates short-term volatility risk. <br> - Protects against further declines. <br> - Psychological relief from market swings. | - Low returns (cash ≈ 0-2%, bonds ≈ 2-4% in EU). <br> - Inflation risk erodes purchasing power. <br> - Misses potential market recovery. <br> - Tax implications (capital gains in Austria: 27.5% on profits). |  
| **Stay Invested**    | - Historically, markets recover after downturns (avg. recovery: ~1-3 years). <br> - Higher expected returns long-term. <br> - Conservative ETFs may still offer stability. | - Further short-term declines possible. <br> - Psychological stress may lead to panic selling later. <br> - Sequence-of-returns risk (early losses hurt long-term sustainability). |  

**Key Insight**: Moving entirely to cash/bonds locks in losses and may not keep pace with inflation, while staying invested risks further short-term declines but offers better recovery potential.  

#### **3. Behavioral Finance Factors (Loss Aversion & Panic Reactions)**  
- **Loss Aversion**: People feel losses ~2x more intensely than gains (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). A 20% drop is distressing, but selling now may worsen long-term outcomes.  
- **Recency Bias**: Recent market turmoil may overshadow long-term trends.  
- **Actionable Mitigation**:  
  - Avoid impulsive decisions; consider a partial reallocation (e.g., 20-30% to bonds) to reduce anxiety.  
  - Focus on historical recovery periods (e.g., 2008, 2020) where markets rebounded within a few years.  

#### **4. Likelihood of Market Recovery Within 2-3 Years**  
- **Historical Precedent**: Since 1950, the average bear market recovery time is ~2.5 years (S&P 500 data, Morningstar).  
- **Current Context**:  
  - Inflation in Europe is declining (ECB tightening cycle likely ending).  
  - Geopolitical risks may persist but are often priced in.  
- **Conclusion**: Moderate chance of recovery, but no guarantees. A conservative portfolio may recover slower than equities.  

#### **5. Pros and Cons of Delaying Retirement**  
| **Pros** | **Cons** |  
|----------|----------|  
| - More time to rebuild savings. <br> - Additional employer/state pension contributions. <br> - Reduces withdrawal rate early in retirement. | - Health/energy may decline. <br> - Opportunity cost of lost leisure time. <br> - May not be necessary if portfolio recovers. |  

**Alternative**: Semi-retirement (reduced hours) to balance income and flexibility.  

#### **6. Recommended Action Plan**  
1. **Partial Reallocation**: Shift 20-30% to short-term EU government bonds (e.g., German Bunds) or inflation-linked bonds to reduce volatility while keeping growth potential.  
2. **Diversify Income Sources**:  
   - Check Austrian pension eligibility (e.g., **state pension + private provisions**).  
   - Consider annuities for guaranteed income (tax-efficient in Austria under certain conditions).  
3. **Withdrawal Strategy**:  
   - Follow the **4% rule** (€370,000 × 4% = ~€14,800/yr), adjusting for inflation.  
   - If portfolio recovers to ~€300,000+, sustainable withdrawals remain possible.  
4. **Tax Optimization**:  
   - Austrian capital gains tax (27.5%) applies only upon selling; avoid unnecessary liquidation.  
   - Use tax-free allowances (€440/year for capital gains).  
5. **Behavioral Guardrails**:  
   - Set a **6-month review** (avoid overreacting to short-term moves).  
   - Consult a **fee-only financial advisor** (Austrian **Vermögensberater** for regulated advice).  

### **Final Recommendation**  
- **Do not fully exit markets** (risk of locking in losses and missing recovery).  
- **Moderate shift toward bonds** (20-30%) to reduce sequence risk.  
- **Assess retirement feasibility in 12 months**—if markets recover, proceed; if not, consider a 1-2 year delay or part-time work.  

**Sources**:  
- ECB monetary policy reports (2023).  
- Austrian capital gains tax law (EStG §27).  
- Kahneman & Tversky (1979) on loss aversion.  
- Morningstar historical market recovery data.  

This approach balances safety, growth potential, and psychological comfort while adapting to the investor’s risk tolerance and time horizon.
