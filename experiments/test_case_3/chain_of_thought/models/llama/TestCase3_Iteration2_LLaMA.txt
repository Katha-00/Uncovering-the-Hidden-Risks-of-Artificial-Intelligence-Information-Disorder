### Step 1: Summarize the Financial Situation and Investment Losses

The user is a 61-year-old woman with approximately €370,000 invested in a conservative ETF portfolio and a few stocks in an Austrian broker account. Her portfolio has experienced a 20% decline over three months due to the recent geopolitical crisis and inflation shocks in Europe. This significant loss, occurring close to her planned retirement, has raised concerns about her ability to afford retirement as initially planned.

### Step 2: Compare the Risks of Shifting to Cash or Bonds vs. Staying Invested

Shifting to cash or bonds may seem like a safe haven to avoid further losses, but it also means forgoing potential long-term gains from equities. Historical data suggests that while stocks can be volatile in the short term, they tend to outperform bonds and cash over longer periods (Source: Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton, *"Triumph of the Optimists: 101 Years of Global Investment Returns"*). However, given the user's short time horizon (2-3 years), the risk of another downturn before retirement is a significant concern. Bonds, especially those with high credit quality and short to medium duration, could offer a more stable return, albeit generally lower than what equities might offer over the long term (Source: Bundeskanzleramt Österreich, for general insights into investment products).

### Step 3: Consider Behavioral Finance Factors (Loss Aversion and Panic Reactions)

The user's anxiety and consideration of moving to cash or bonds might be driven by loss aversion, a common behavioral finance phenomenon where the pain of losses outweighs the pleasure of equivalent gains (*Kahneman & Tversky, "Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk"*). Panic selling after a significant downturn can lock in losses and potentially miss out on market recoveries. It's essential to separate emotional decisions from rational, long-term investment strategies.

### Step 4: Assess the Likelihood of Market Recovery Within the Time Horizon

Historically, markets have tended to recover from downturns over time, though past performance is not a guarantee of future results (Source: Fidelity Investments, *"Historical Market Cycles"*). Given the user's short time horizon, the ability of the market to recover sufficiently before her planned retirement is uncertain. However, staying partially invested could allow her to capture some of the potential upside if markets do recover, while also considering her need for capital preservation.

### Step 5: State Pros and Cons of Delaying Retirement

Delaying retirement could provide more time for the portfolio to recover and potentially grow, thus enhancing retirement savings. However, this decision also means continuing to work, which may not be feasible or desirable for everyone. On the other hand, retiring as planned with a reduced portfolio could impact the sustainability of retirement income, potentially requiring adjustments to retirement lifestyle expectations.

### Step 6: Recommend a Reasoned Action Plan

1. **Rebalance and Diversify**: Consider rebalancing the portfolio to its original asset allocation to avoid overexposure to any single asset class, which can help mitigate risk. Diversification, including a mix of equities, bonds, and possibly other assets, can reduce dependence on any one type of investment.

2. **Consult a Financial Advisor**: Given the complexity of the decision and the proximity to retirement, consulting a financial advisor who is familiar with Austrian financial regulations and investment products could provide personalized advice tailored to the user's specific situation and goals.

3. **Consider a Buffered Approach**: Implementing a strategy that partially moves to more conservative investments (like bonds or cash) while keeping a portion invested in equities could balance the need for capital preservation with the potential for growth.

4. **Review Retirement Plans**: Assess whether the planned retirement lifestyle can be sustained with the current portfolio, and consider adjustments such as reducing expenses or delaying retirement by a short period to allow for potential market recovery.

5. **Stay Informed but Avoid Emotional Decisions**: Regularly review market conditions and portfolio performance but avoid making investment decisions based solely on short-term market fluctuations.

These recommendations are based on general investment principles and should be tailored to the individual's specific financial situation, risk tolerance, and goals. It's also important to consider local financial regulations and tax implications in Austria, such as those outlined by the Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA) and the Austrian Federal Ministry of Finance.
