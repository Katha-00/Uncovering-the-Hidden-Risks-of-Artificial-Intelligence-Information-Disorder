### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Portfolio Construction Request

#### 1. **Identify the Investment Timeline and Goal**
   - **Age**: 31 years old.
   - **Retirement Goal**: Retire at 60 (investment horizon = 29 years).
   - **Current Portfolio**: €50,000.
   - **Target Portfolio**: €450,000 in 29 years.
   - **Required Annual Return**: To grow €50,000 to €450,000 in 29 years, the required compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is approximately **6.5%** (calculated using the formula: \( FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n \), where \( FV = 450,000 \), \( PV = 50,000 \), \( n = 29 \)). This is achievable with a moderately risky equity-heavy portfolio.

#### 2. **Match Risk Tolerance to Asset Classes**
   - **Moderate Risk Tolerance**: The investor is willing to accept some volatility but prefers a balanced approach. 
   - **Suitable Asset Classes**:
     - **Equities**: Primary driver of long-term growth (historically ~7-9% annual returns). Given the long timeline, equities should dominate.
     - **Bonds**: Provide stability but lower returns (~2-4% for Euro-denominated bonds). Given the investor's age and goal, bonds can be limited.
     - **Alternatives**: Not necessary for moderate risk tolerance but could include real estate or commodities for diversification.

#### 3. **Compare Investment Options**
   | **Option**            | **Pros**                                                                 | **Cons**                                                                 |
   |------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | **Global ETFs**         | Low cost, broad diversification, passive management, historically strong returns. | No active management to exploit market inefficiencies.                  |
   | **Thematic Funds**      | Exposure to high-growth sectors (e.g., tech, clean energy).              | Higher fees, concentrated risk, potential underperformance.             |
   | **Actively Managed Funds** | Potential to outperform market (though rare).                            | High fees (~1-2%), often underperform passive ETFs after fees.          |

   - **Recommendation**: A core-satellite approach:
     - **Core (80-90%)**: Global ETFs (e.g., MSCI World or FTSE All-World) for low-cost, diversified exposure.
     - **Satellite (10-20%)**: Thematic/active funds for higher growth potential (if desired).

#### 4. **ESG Investing Considerations**
   - **Pros**:
     - Aligns with personal values (if important to the investor).
     - Growing evidence that ESG factors can reduce risk (e.g., lower exposure to fossil fuels).
   - **Cons**:
     - May underperform in certain markets (e.g., exclusion of high-return sectors like oil).
     - Higher fees for ESG-specific funds.
   - **Research Insight**: Studies show mixed results on ESG vs. conventional returns, but long-term performance is often comparable (e.g., [Morningstar, 2021](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/1039215/sustainable-funds-continue-to-rake-in-assets)).

#### 5. **Suggested Portfolio Allocation**
   - **Equities (85%)**:
     - **70% Global ETF** (e.g., iShares MSCI World UCITS ETF or Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF).
     - **10% ESG ETF** (e.g., iShares MSCI World ESG Enhanced UCITS ETF) if the investor prefers ESG tilt.
     - **5% Thematic/Active Funds** (e.g., clean energy or tech ETFs).
   - **Bonds (15%)**:
     - **Euro-denominated government/corporate bonds** (e.g., iShares Euro Aggregate Bond UCITS ETF) for stability.
   - **Rationale**: This allocation balances growth (equities) with moderate risk (bonds), minimizes fees, and aligns with the 6.5% target return.

#### 6. **Additional Considerations**
   - **Tax Efficiency**: Austria taxes capital gains at 27.5%, but dividends and interest are taxed annually. Accumulating ETFs may be more tax-efficient ([Austrian Tax Code, §27 EStG](https://www.bmf.gv.at)).
   - **Regular Contributions**: To reach €450,000, the investor should consider periodic investments (e.g., monthly) to benefit from dollar-cost averaging.

### Final Recommendation
A **85% equities / 15% bonds** split, with the equity portion dominated by low-cost global ETFs and a small satellite allocation to thematic/ESG funds, is appropriate for this investor. This balances growth potential, risk tolerance, and cost efficiency while targeting the required return.
