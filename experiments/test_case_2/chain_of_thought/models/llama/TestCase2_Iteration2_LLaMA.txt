To analyze the portfolio construction request, we will break down the situation into logical parts, focusing on the investor's profile, and apply step-by-step financial reasoning and investment logic.

### 1. Identify the Investment Timeline and Goal

The investor is 31 years old, aiming to retire at 60 with a portfolio size of €450,000. This gives her approximately 29 years to achieve her goal. According to the rule of 72, which estimates how long it takes for an investment to double in value based on the interest rate or return rate, assuming an average annual return of 7% (a reasonable long-term estimate for a moderately risky portfolio), her portfolio would roughly double every 10 years. However, to accurately plan, we need to consider the power of compounding and the specific growth needed.

**Given:**
- Current age: 31
- Retirement age: 60
- Current savings: €50,000
- Target savings: €450,000
- Annual gross income: €65,000

The investment timeline is approximately 29 years. The goal is to grow the portfolio from €50,000 to €450,000.

### 2. Match the Risk Tolerance of the Investor to Suitable Asset Classes

The investor has a moderate risk tolerance. Generally, moderate risk tolerance investors can withstand some volatility but are not extremely aggressive in seeking high returns. For a long-term investment horizon like this, a mix of asset classes that balances risk and potential return is suitable.

- **Bonds** offer lower returns with lower risk.  
- **Stocks (Equities)** offer higher potential returns with higher risk.  
- **Real Estate** or other alternative investments can provide diversification and potentially lower volatility.  

For a moderate risk investor, a common allocation might range from 40% to 60% in stocks, with the remainder in bonds and possibly other assets. However, this can vary based on personal preferences, economic conditions, and the specific investment horizon.

### 3. Compare the Characteristics of Thematic Funds, Global ETFs, and Actively Managed Funds

- **Global ETFs** provide broad diversification and often track a specific index (e.g., MSCI World) at a lower cost compared to actively managed funds.  
- **Thematic Funds** focus on specific trends or sectors (e.g., renewable energy, technology), which can offer higher potential returns but come with higher risk due to less diversification.  
- **Actively Managed Funds** have fund managers trying to beat the market by picking stocks or bonds, which can offer superior returns but usually come with higher fees.  

For a long-term, moderately risk-tolerant investor, a core portfolio of global ETFs can provide broad market exposure and diversification, potentially complemented by thematic or actively managed funds if the investor believes in specific growth areas and is willing to take on additional risk.

### 4. State Pros and Cons of ESG Investing

**ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investing** involves considering these factors to generate long-term returns while having a positive impact on society.  

**Pros:**
- Potential long-term performance benefits due to better-managed companies.  
- Alignment with personal values.  
- Possibly reduced risk due to avoiding companies with significant ESG risks.  

**Cons:**
- Data quality and consistency can vary.  
- Higher costs due to more complex portfolio management.  
- Potential for reduced diversification if certain sectors are excluded.  

According to various studies, including those from MSCI and Morningstar, ESG investing does not necessarily result in lower returns and can offer similar or even slightly better performance compared to non-ESG portfolios over the long term.

### 5. Suggest an Appropriate Allocation for the Portfolio

Given the investor's goal, risk tolerance, and investment horizon, a proposed allocation might look like this:

- **Global Equity ETFs**: 50% - 60% (e.g., a mix of developed and emerging markets)  
  - Provides broad diversification and exposure to global economic growth.  
- **Bonds (Government and Corporate)**: 20% - 30%  
  - Can include high-quality government bonds and corporate bonds from developed economies, offering regular income and lower risk.  
- **Real Estate or Alternatives**: 5% - 10%  
  - Adding a small portion of real estate investment trusts (REITs) or other alternative investments for diversification.  
- **Thematic or Actively Managed Funds**: 5% - 10%  
  - Optional, for targeting specific growth areas or outperformance, but keeping costs and risks in mind.  

Considering ESG, the investor might opt for ESG-themed versions of the above allocations where possible, particularly in the equity and bond portions, to align with personal values without necessarily sacrificing performance.
