Given your moderate risk tolerance, long-term investment horizon, and goal to retire early with a substantial portfolio, I'll outline a portfolio allocation recommendation. Please note that this is a general suggestion, and it's essential to consult with a financial advisor or conduct your own research before making investment decisions.

**Global ETF Portfolio:**  
A well-diversified global ETF portfolio can provide broad market exposure, reducing risk and increasing potential returns. A common allocation for a moderate risk investor is:

* 60% Stocks (Equities)  
  + 40% Developed Markets (e.g., MSCI World ETF)  
  + 20% Emerging Markets (e.g., MSCI Emerging Markets ETF)  
* 30% Bonds (Fixed Income)  
  + 20% Government Bonds (e.g., Eurozone Government Bond ETF)  
  + 10% Corporate Bonds (e.g., Eurozone Corporate Bond ETF)  
* 10% Alternatives (e.g., Real Estate, Commodities, or a diversified Alternative ETF)

**Thematic or Actively Managed Funds:**  
While thematic or actively managed funds can be attractive, they often come with higher fees and may not outperform the market in the long run. If you still want to include them in your portfolio, consider allocating a smaller portion (e.g., 10–20%) to these funds. Some popular thematic areas include:

* Technology (e.g., robotics, artificial intelligence)  
* Sustainability (e.g., renewable energy, green infrastructure)  
* Healthcare (e.g., biotechnology, pharmaceuticals)

**ESG Investing:**  
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing considers non-financial factors that can impact long-term performance. While some studies suggest that ESG investing may lead to slightly lower returns, others argue that it can have a neutral or even positive effect.

**Recommendation:**  
Considering your moderate risk tolerance and long-term goals, I suggest allocating your €50,000 portfolio as follows:

* 50% Global Equity ETF (e.g., MSCI World ETF)  
* 20% Eurozone Government Bond ETF  
* 10% Eurozone Corporate Bond ETF  
* 10% Real Estate or Alternative ETF  
* 5% Thematic or Actively Managed Fund (optional)  
* 5% ESG-focused ETF (optional)  

This allocation provides a diversified foundation, with a moderate risk profile. If you choose to include thematic or ESG-focused investments, do so in a limited capacity, as they may come with higher fees or unique risks.

**Growth Projections:**  
To estimate the potential growth of your portfolio, let's assume an average annual return of 6–7% (a reasonable expectation for a moderate risk portfolio). Using a compound interest calculator or spreadsheet, you can estimate the potential growth of your portfolio over time.

Assuming you contribute €5,000 annually to your portfolio and aim to reach €450,000 by age 60, you can estimate the required average annual return. Based on this calculation, your current portfolio allocation and contributions should be sufficient to reach your goal, assuming a moderate level of risk and average market returns.

**Final Note:**  
Please keep in mind that this is a general recommendation, and it's essential to:

1. Consult with a financial advisor or conduct your own research before making investment decisions.  
2. Review and adjust your portfolio regularly to ensure it remains aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.  
3. Consider tax implications, fees, and other expenses associated with your investments.
