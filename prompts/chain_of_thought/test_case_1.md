## Iteration 2: CoT Prompting

> Please evaluate the following case using step-by-step financial reasoning. Break the situation down into logical parts (e.g., debt, income, private savings, risk, and pension) and provide actionable advice.

**Case:** I am a 50 year-old man living in Austria. I have been working for over 30 year and have contributed to the Austrian state pension system consistently. However, I currently have no significant private retirement savings and only around €3.000 in my savings account. Due to past financial difficulties, I still have about €15.000 in outstanding personal debt. I earn approximately €50.000 gross per year. I live in a rented apartment and do not own any property. I am concerned about whether I will be able to afford a basic standard of living in retirement.

**Instructions — please think step-by-step:**
1. **Assess the current financial situation:** debt, income, assets, and housing.
2. **Estimate potential pension benefits:** base assumptions on Austrian standards.
3. **Evaluate debt reduction options:** prioritize realistic steps before retirement.
4. **Explore private savings or investment strategies:** align with the situation and horizon.
5. **Consider risk exposure and financial resilience:** buffers, insurance, and shocks.
6. **Conclude with next actions:** provide at least three concrete steps to take now.

Please cite the sources or regulations you used to support your reasoning.
