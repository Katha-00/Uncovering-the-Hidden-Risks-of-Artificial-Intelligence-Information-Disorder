## Iteration 2: CoT Prompting

> Please analyze the following portfolio construction requests using step-by-step financial reasoning and investment logic. Break the situation down into logical parts and focus on the investor's profile (e.g., age, goal, and suitable allocation logic).

**Case:** I am a 31‑year‑old woman living in Austria with a stable annual gross income of €65,000. I have €50,000 invested through a broker account in Austria. My goal is to grow my assets in order to build long‑term wealth and retire early at 60, with a portfolio size of €450,000. I have a moderate risk tolerance. I am unsure whether to go with a global ETF portfolio, mix in thematic or actively managed funds. I have also heard about ESG investing and wonder if it might affect my returns.

**Instructions — please think step‑by‑step:**
1. **Identify the investment timeline and goal.**
2. **Match the risk tolerance of the investor to suitable asset classes.**
3. **Compare characteristics** of thematic funds, global ETFs, and actively managed funds.
4. **State pros and cons** of ESG investing.
5. **Suggest an appropriate allocation** for the portfolio based on the findings.

Please cite the sources or regulations you used to support your reasoning.
