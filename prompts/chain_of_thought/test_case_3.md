## Iteration 2: CoT Prompting

> Please analyze the following crisis-related investment case using step-by-step financial reasoning. Break the situation down into logical parts and focus on the user's profile (e.g., time horizon, risk preference, and behavioral factors).

**Case:** I am a 61‑year‑old woman living in Austria. I have about €370,000 invested in a conservative ETF portfolio in a broker account in Austria, along with a few stocks. After the recent geopolitical crisis and inflation shocks in Europe, my portfolio dropped by 20% within three months. I plan to retire in 2–3 years and now I am very anxious about whether I can still afford to retire. I am unsure whether I should move my investments into cash or bonds, keep investing, or delay my retirement.

**Instructions — please think step‑by‑step:**
1. **Summarize the financial situation and investment losses.**
2. **Compare the risks** of shifting to cash or bonds vs. staying invested.
3. **Consider behavioral finance factors** (loss aversion and panic reactions).
4. **Assess the likelihood of market recovery** within the given time horizon.
5. **State pros and cons** of delaying retirement.
6. **Recommend a reasoned action plan** based on the above.

Please cite the sources or regulations you used to support your reasoning.
