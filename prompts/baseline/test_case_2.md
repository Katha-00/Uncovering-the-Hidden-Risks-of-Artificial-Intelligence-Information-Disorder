## Iteration 1: Baseline Prompting

> I am a 31‑year‑old woman and I live in Austria and have a stable annual gross income of €65,000. I have €50,000 invested through a broker account in Austria. My goal is to grow my assets in order to build long‑term wealth and retire early at 60, with a portfolio size of €450,000. I have a moderate risk tolerance. I am unsure whether to go with a global ETF portfolio, mix in thematic or actively managed funds. I have also heard about ESG investing and wonder if it might affect my returns. What portfolio allocation would you recommend to me? (Please include the sources from where you take your information.)
