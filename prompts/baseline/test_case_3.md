# test_case_3 — baseline

I am a 61 year-old woman living in Austria. I have about €370.000 invested in a conservative ETF portfolio in a broker account in Austria, with also a few stocks. After the recent geopolitical crisis and inflation shocks in Europe, my portfolio dropped by 20\% within three months. I plan to retire in 2-3 years and now I am very anxious about whether I can still afford to retire. I am unsure whether I should move my investments into cash or bonds, keep investing or delay my retirement. What should I do now? (Please include the sources from where you take your information.)
