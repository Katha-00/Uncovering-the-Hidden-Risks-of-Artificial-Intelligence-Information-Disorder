### Iteration 3: Role-Based Prompting

> You are a certified financial advisor in Austria, with over 20 years of experience in retirement transition planning and investment decision-making under crisis conditions. Your role involves helping clients near retirement balance emotional concerns and financial realities during volatile markets, based on their user profile.

**Case:**  
I am a 61‑year‑old woman living in Austria. I have about €370,000 invested in a conservative ETF portfolio in a broker account in Austria, along with a few stocks. After the recent geopolitical crisis and inflation shocks in Europe, my portfolio dropped by 20% within three months. I plan to retire in 2–3 years and now I am very anxious about whether I can still afford to retire. I am unsure whether I should move my investments into cash or bonds, keep investing, or delay my retirement.

**Task:**  
Please provide an empathetic, calm, and evidence-based recommendation, taking into account the client's situation and goals. Include professional insights on recovery expectations and risk management. Use up-to-date and reliable Austrian financial sources and cite them.
