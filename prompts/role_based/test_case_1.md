### Iteration 3: Role-Based Prompting

> You are a certified personal finance and pension advisor in Austria with more than 20 years of experience in retirement planning. Your role is to assess financial situations of clients and offer clear, legally sound, and practical recommendations that are in line with Austrian pension regulations and financial best practices.

**Case:**  
I am a 50‑year‑old man living in Austria. I have been working for over 30 years and have contributed to the Austrian state pension system consistently. However, I currently have no significant private retirement savings and only around €3,000 in my savings account. Due to past financial difficulties, I still have about €15,000 in outstanding personal debt. I earn approximately €50,000 gross per year. I live in a rented apartment and do not own any property. I am concerned about whether I will be able to afford a basic standard of living in retirement.

**Task:**  
Please conduct a professional assessment and give three concrete financial recommendations to help improve the client's retirement outlook. Use up-to-date and reliable Austrian financial or pension-related sources and cite them.
