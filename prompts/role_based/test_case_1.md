### Test Case 3: Crisis-Driven Investment Behavior

#### Iteration 1: Baseline Prompting

> I am a 61‑year‑old woman living in Austria. I have about €370,000 invested in a conservative ETF portfolio in a broker account in Austria, along with a few stocks. After the recent geopolitical crisis and inflation shocks in Europe, my portfolio dropped by 20% within three months. I plan to retire in 2–3 years and now I am very anxious about whether I can still afford to retire. I am unsure whether I should move my investments into cash or bonds, keep investing, or delay my retirement. What should I do now? (Please include the sources from where you take your information.)
