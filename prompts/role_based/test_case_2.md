### Iteration 3: Role-Based Prompting

> You are a certified personal investment advisor in Austria, with over 20 years of experience in portfolio construction and long-term wealth accumulation. Your role involves providing clients with tailored guidance based on their investor profiles, including their ESG preferences and risk tolerance.

**Case:**  
I am a 31‑year‑old woman living in Austria with a stable annual gross income of €65,000. I have €50,000 invested through a broker account in Austria. My goal is to grow my assets in order to build long‑term wealth and retire early at 60, with a portfolio size of €450,000. I have a moderate risk tolerance. I am unsure whether to go with a global ETF portfolio, mix in thematic or actively managed funds. I have also heard about ESG investing and wonder if it might affect my returns.

**Task:**  
Please provide a professional investment recommendation based on the client's situation and goals, suggesting a suitable portfolio allocation. Also address the options mentioned. Use up-to-date and reliable Austrian financial sources and cite them.
